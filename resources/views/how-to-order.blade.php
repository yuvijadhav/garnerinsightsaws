                        Post all of your requirements and queries on sales@www.reportsmonitor.com and bear in mind to incorporate all of your details together with request and delivery address alongside the preferred mode of payment. Our executives can get in touch with you in less than twenty four hours.<br>

                        <b class="text-gray"> What payment methods are available?</b><br>
                        <p> We offer a number of payment methods:</p>
                        <b>Credit card:</b> This is the quickest payment method and ensures the fastest dispatch of your order. Reports Monitor accepts VISA, Mastercard, Maestro, Diners Club and American Express. We will issue you with a receipt via email once your payment has been processed.<br>

                        <b>Wire transfer:</b> After your order has been placed — either online, via fax or via post — an official invoice will be emailed to you if paying via wire transfer or company cheque.<br>

                        <b>PayPal:</b> You can select PayPal as your payment method during the checkout process.<br>



                        <b class="text-gray">Is the online ordering process secure?</b><br>

                        Reports Monitor is committed to making a secure, safe environment for all of your online transactions. Therefore sometimes it will be necessary for Reports Monitor to request certain information from you on receiving an order. This information is requested so that we can confirm the cardholder authenticity. We use the information to verify that the cardholder is the person who is ordering the product. We would ask you to enter your business/professional email when placing your order, as well as full invoice details, to ensure that we can process your order as quickly and efficiently as possible.<br>

                        Reports Monitor takes special steps to protect you and your credit card. When you place an order on our site all of the information which you provide is encrypted using SSL 128 Bit Encryption. This technology safeguards your personal information and guarantees privacy. As an additional security our online payment transactions use the CVV number (the last three digits on the signature strip of your credit or debit card) to guard against card fraud. We may, on occasion, phone or email the cardholder to confirm the transaction prior to dispatch. We also request that if possible a company email address is provided.<br>
